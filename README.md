## 📖 About The Project

This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment of a Java-based E-Commerce application using a complete CI/CD pipeline.

The application is built, tested, analyzed for code quality, containerized, security scanned, pushed to DockerHub, and deployed to an Amazon EKS (Kubernetes) cluster using Jenkins automation.

It reflects a real-world DevOps workflow with proper artifact management, container orchestration, and automated deployment on AWS.
